# exemploRunOnUiThread
This simple example will show you how to download one image from web and show that image in one image view, we know that we can't download using the main Thread, we need do this in another thread and also we can't access one object view out of the Thread where this element went created.
This example will show for you how to do this :)

Obs.: Don't forget to enable the permission to internet in the manifest.
Ex.: <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.INTERNET"/>
